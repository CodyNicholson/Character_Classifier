# Data Mining - Final Presentation

Slide 1: Title of project & Team

Slide 2: Problem statement

Slide 3: Why is it important?

Slide 4-5: Related work, what are those people doing in those papers? Raicu et all 2013, proposed a CAD using decision trees and got 85% (And describe paper).

Slide 6-10: Talk about related work and methodology. Data description, Data preprocessing, Class labels, discrete data, supervised learning, compare to other algorithms. Pattern discovery. How do you evaluate.?

Slide 11-13: Results of evaluation on many different algorithms

Slide 14: Conclusion and future work (need more data/etc)

***

Methodology: Is the data balanced? (equal number of cases from each class). How many instances are from each class?

Include attribute/parameter definitions

Discrete variable = pie or bar chart
Scale = histogram
Classification table SPSS
