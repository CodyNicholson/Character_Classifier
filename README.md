# Character Classifier

This was a project I worked on for my CSC367 - Foundations in Data Science class that I took at DePaul University. In this project I created a convolutional neural network based on the one created by Yann LeCun called LeNet. My model has been trained using the MINST dataset of hand-drawn characters, so it can predict the labels for hand-drawn characters with an accuracy of 98.9%.
